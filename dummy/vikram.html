<p>Vikram's father, Vinod Raj, was a small time actor who did not fare successfully in films and only
 managed to act in supporting roles in Tamil films and television 
serials.<br>This inspired Vikram to take theatre lessons and become professionally trained in classical and cinema dance
 forms to ensure that he became a leading actor.</br></p>

<p>Vikram began his <del>professional career</del> by <ins><i>modelling</i></ins> in advert films for brands including Chola Tea,
 <u><b>TVS Excel</b></u> and Alwyn watches as well as appearing in a six episode television serial titled Galatta Kudumbam,
 which aired between November and December 1988. During the final year of his <strong>M.B.A programme</strong> at <em>Loyola College</em>,
 he was recognised by the film industry, with veteran director C. V. Sridhar approaching him for a lead role in a film.
 Vikram made his film debut in 1990 by appearing in En Kadhal Kanmani, a small-budget love story featuring him alongside Rekha Nambiar,
 with Sridhar's Thanthu Vitten Ennai, opposite Rohini being his next release. He then signed on to be a part of cinematographer
 P. C. Sriram's <mark>college love story Meera</mark>, with high expectations, however, the three films failed to launch his career.[19] His appearances in 
Meera and in Kaaval Geetham, with another veteran director S. P. Muthuraman, helped him secure film offers from the Malayalam and Telugu film industries.
[18] In 1993, he almost signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam's Bombay and featured in the initial photo shoot alongside Manisha Koirala. 
However, Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove his beard for the <small>role</small>,
and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project.
